### **Orca Eye Aye model RAIL-M**

Licensed Artifact(s):

   - Model


NOTE: The primary difference between a RAIL and OpenRAIL license is that the RAIL license does not require the licensee to have royalty-free use of the relevant artifact(s), nor does the RAIL license necessarily permit modifications to the artifact(s). Both RAIL and OpenRAIL licenses include use restrictions prohibiting certain uses of the licensed artifact(s).

**Section I: PREAMBLE**

This RAIL License is generally applicable to the Artifact(s) identified above.

For valuable consideration, You and Licensor agree as follows:

**1. Definitions**

(a) “**Application**” refers to a sequence of instructions or statements written in machine code language, including object code (that is the product of a compiler), binary code (data using a two-symbol system) or an intermediate language (such as register transfer language).

(b) “**Artifact**” refers to a software application (in either binary or source code format), Model, and/or Source Code, in accordance with what is specified above as the “Licensed Artifact”.

(c) "**Contribution**" means any work, including any modifications or additions to an Artifact, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion or incorporation in the Artifact directly or indirectly by the rights owner. For the purposes of this definition, “**submitted**” means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing, sharing and improving the Artifact, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the contributor as "**Not a Contribution.**"

(d) "**Contributor**" means Licensor or any other individual or legal entity that creates or owns a Contribution that is added to or incorporated into an Artifact.

(k) **“Output”** means the results of operating a Model as embodied in informational content resulting therefrom.

(i) “**Source Code**” means any collection of text written using human-readable programming language, including the code and scripts used to define, run, load, benchmark or evaluate a Model or any component thereof, and/or used to prepare data for training or evaluation, if any.

For clarity, the term “Source Code” as used in this License includes any and all Derivatives of such Source Code.

(n) **“Use”** includes accessing and utilizing an Artifact, and may, in connection with a Model, also include creating content, fine-tuning, updating, running, training, evaluating and/or re-parametrizing such Model.

**Section II: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS**

Both copyright and patent grants may apply to the Artifact. The Artifact is subject to additional terms as described in Section III below, which govern the use of the Artifact in the event that Section II is held unenforceable or inapplicable.

**2. Grant of Copyright License**. Conditioned upon compliance with Section III below and subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce (for internal purposes), use, publicly display, and publicly perform the Artifact.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Artifact and/or a Contribution incorporated within the Artifact constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License in connection with the Artifact shall terminate as of the date such litigation is asserted or filed.

Licensor and Contributor each have the right to grant the licenses above.
