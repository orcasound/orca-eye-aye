### Most Recent Added Dataset
- added on Jul/13/23: **_vesselDetection_071023_**   
note: This dataset includes data from July and October 2022. Includes 2641 vessel images across all classes.

### About Marine Monitor (M2)
Marine Monitor (M2) is a shore-based, multi-sensor platform that integrates X-band marine radar, optical cameras, and other sensors with custom software to autonomously track and report on vessel activity in nearshore areas. By using radar, vessels of all types are tracked by the system, including smaller boats that are typically not required to participate in common tracking systems. M2 also receives and documents vessel information from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) which is primarily used by larger commercial vessels. The camera is dynamically directed to vessel locations, provided by both radar and AIS, throughout its trip, so that images are captured while vessels are within range of the M2 system. M2 was designed by ProtectedSeas as a tool for marine managers to more effectively monitor and document human activities in sensitive marine areas.
